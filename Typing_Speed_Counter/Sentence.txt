Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank;
 repeated the operation; did it again; and singing Buffalo Gals. compared the 
insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed,
and sat down on a tree-box. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail,
Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes,
 before,but now it did not strike him so.He remembered that there was company .
White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, 
resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, skylarking.  generally had to go after him.
And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off,
Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour--and even then somebody
 Tom said: "Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some." Thank you.
